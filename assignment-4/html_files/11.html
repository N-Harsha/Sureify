        Easier - A mountain is a large amount of land that rises high above its surroundings. It is a large, steep hill. A mountain range is a group of connected mountains.

        Harder - A mountain towers above its neighboring landforms. Mountains are found all over the world, including in the ocean. The term mountain can refer to a single peak, a series of mountains called a mountain
range, or a whole mountain system that encompasses a group of mountain ranges. Mountains usually have steep, sloping sides and sharp or slightly rounded ridges and peaks. Mountains are usually larger than hills. However, what some call a hill in one location may actually be larger than mountains somewhere else. For example in the United States, the Black Hills of South Dakota are higher than the Ouachita Mountains of
Arkansas.

    Many geologists specify that a mountain must include two or more zones of climate and plant life at different elevation levels. In most parts of the world, a mountain must reach 2,000 feet (600 meters) above its
    surroundings in order to include two climate zones.
